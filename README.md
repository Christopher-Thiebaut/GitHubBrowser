#Welcome to GitHubBrowser

GitHub Browser is an iOS app which allows you to search for repositories and view the commit history of those repositories on an iOS device.

##What is this repository good for? 

If you're interested in hiring it's author, it's a good starting point for evaluating his coding skills (though I'd still recommend an in-person interview ðŸ˜‰). 

 If you're new to iOS development or have never used a GraphQL api before, then you can use this as an example to learn from (but look at lots of examples, everbody makes different compromises in development and you should learn from lots of different people).
 
##How to use this repository:
If you clone this repository and immediately try to run it, you won't be able to browse anything.  That's because GitHub's API requires an access token, and I didn't want to put my personal access token up on a public repository.

To use your own personal access token with this app, create an enviromnment variable in your clone of the repository with **"github-access-token"** as the name and your actual access token as the value.

If you're not sure how to set environment variables, instructions can be found [here](https://nshipster.com/launch-arguments-and-environment-variables/).

If you're not sure how to generate a personal access token, instructions can be found [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).  I recommend keeping the scope of your access token as limited as you can in case your token is ever leaked or made public. If you only want/need to view public repositories (yours or someone else's), you can uncheck all of the scope boxes when you create your repository; this will limit the motivation and potential for others to abuse your token.

If you want to actually publish an app based on this repository and not just launch it from Xcode, you will have to create your own implementation of `TokenProvider` that gets your access token from somewhere other than an environment variable. Be careful about hard-coding it into your app, as that's a good way to get your token leaked.
